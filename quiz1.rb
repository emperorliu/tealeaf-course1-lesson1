1. a = 1

2. Array is indexed by its order, whereas hashes include key-value pairs

3. arr = [1,2,3,3] returns => [1,2,3,3]
  [1,2,3,3].uniq returns => [1,2,3]
  [1,2,3,3].uniq returns => [1,2,3]

4. 'select' uses a boolean and returns an array where that boolean is true. 'map' maps what you want to do to each item in an array. 

  For example, if I wanted to create an array where it only retrieved the odd numbers of my existing array, then I would use select, and not map.

  5. h = {"string" => "blahblah", "string" => "blahblah"}

  6. "no way!"
